# Face-Recognition-software

( Made @ ONSRT's Summer dev Comp√©tition ) 

Face recognition software using Python ( Face Recogn. scripts ) and C# ( For UI )

So this project is a software to recognise students / employees just by saving their pictures and train the face recognition tool using those Images


To try the Software u can simply install it and use it directly , but if you want to know more about the python script, feel free to download the python folder  in my repository and
do the following : 

    
     1- start by running get_imgs.py   ( It will save any face located in front of your computer's camera  + it will ask u to label this person ).
     You can try multiple faces by executing this file multiple times.
	 

     2- Then execute faces_train.py  ( it will train all the images corresponding to each label ) and save the model and the labels in separate files
	 

     3-  And finally, execute facerecogn.py . ( it will detect now any person trained in the model  with a confidence of 85% )


For more details please do leave a comment , this is a project in developpement , it's not the final result
